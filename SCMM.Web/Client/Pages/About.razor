            <span>SCMM is a tool I created out of the desire to track my inventory performance against the Steam Community Market.</span><br />
            <span>The market has a wealth of useful infomation, but a very minimalistic user interface. My aim is to bring this information to the surface and build tools around it to assist with marketplace trading.</span>
